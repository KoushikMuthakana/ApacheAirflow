    " * A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a finite graph doesn't have any cycles(loops)\n",
    " * In Apache airflow, DAG represents collections of tasks to run, orginized in a way that represent their dependencies and relationships.\n",
    " * Each node is a task\n",
    " * Each edge is a Dependency\n",

    "*         Node C - Process the data\n",

    "#### Important Properties:\n",
    "* DAGs are defined by python files placed into Airflow's DAG_FOLDER (Usually ~/airflow/dags), can be configurable\n",

    "* description - Description of DAG\n",
